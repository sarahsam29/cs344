Exercise 8.2:

a) The benefit for FTRL is that it can scale the learning rate differently for different coefficients. This is particularly 
beneficial for those features which have non-zero numbers.

b) Bucketization, also known as binning, is a process to divide the data into categories. This allows the neural net to have 
more meaningful/representative data that are in smaller chunks. I assume that having clustered data can help to curb bias or 
overgeneralization. 

c) Solutions to Task 1 and 2: 
 
  Task 1: 
    bucketized_latitude = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
      latitude, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
        training_examples["latitude"], 10))

    bucketized_housing_median_age = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
      housing_median_age, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
        training_examples["housing_median_age"], 7))

    bucketized_median_income = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
     median_income, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
        training_examples["median_income"], 7))

    bucketized_rooms_per_person = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
      rooms_per_person, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
        training_examples["rooms_per_person"], 7))

    feature_columns = set([
      bucketized_longitude,
      bucketized_latitude,
      bucketized_housing_median_age,
      bucketized_households,
      bucketized_median_income,
      bucketized_rooms_per_person])

    return feature_columns

  _ = train_model(
      learning_rate=1.0,
      steps=500,
      batch_size=100,
      feature_columns=construct_feature_columns(),
      training_examples=training_examples,
      training_targets=training_targets,
      validation_examples=validation_examples,
      validation_targets=validation_targets)

    RMSE: 
    89.9. Because of how good this RMSE is binning sounds like a good idea for this model. 
  
  Task 2: 
  
    I chose to cross feature housing_median_age and median_income, because together you can learn about the impact of income
    on home-ownership. 

   housingMedianAge_x_medianIncome = tf.feature_column.crossed_column(
   set([bucketized_housing_median_age, bucketized_median_income]), hash_bucket_size=1000)

    feature_columns = set([
      bucketized_longitude,
      bucketized_latitude,
      bucketized_housing_median_age,
      bucketized_households,
      bucketized_median_income,
      bucketized_rooms_per_person,
      housingMedianAge_x_medianIncome])

    return feature_columns

    RMSE: 82.75
