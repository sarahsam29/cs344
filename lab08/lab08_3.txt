a) Seaborn is based on MatPlotlib and seems flexible. It has the ability to generate a variety of plots and be able to 
correlate many variables simultaneously. MatPlotlib has more structure, and allows for greater details and complexity in plots.

b) The dataset has 397 observations, which is fairly small. But, it could serve to give us a rough/initial estimate.

c) Because each feature is on a different scale, it will be useful to have them all of the same scale. This way, the weights of 
the neural nets will work better, and in general we won’t have a model that is dependent on the input.

d) I am actually not certain if this is a linear regression model. But by looking at the visual output of the Mean Square 
Error[mpg], which  has a non-linear trend, I believe that this is a non-linear regression.

e) I agree, it seems as if smaller networks would fit a small network appropriately. I’m assuming that if the model is more 
complex and there isn’t enough data, this may cause an issue of over-fitting. But if the model is simple and there is a lot of 
data you might struggle with under-fitting.
