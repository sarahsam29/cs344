Exercise 8.1:

a) The Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) is a measure of linear correlation between two variables (generally the 
response and explanatory). The values of a PCC can fall between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates complete negative correlation
between the two variables, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a complete positive correlation. Median income has 
a 0.7 pcc with the target, which makes sense because the target is based off of the median income but is also interaction 
with the other features.


b) solutions to task 1 and 2: 

Task 1:
    minimal_features = [
        "median_income",
        "housing_median_age"
    ]
    minimal_training_examples = training_examples[minimal_features]
    minimal_validation_examples = validation_examples[minimal_features]

    train_model(
        learning_rate=0.01,
        steps=1000,
        batch_size=5,
        training_examples=minimal_training_examples,
        training_targets=training_targets,
        validation_examples=minimal_validation_examples,
        validation_targets=validation_targets)

    RMSE: 
    111.61, while google's was 113.01. I barely beat it. And, I also noticed that my features are not all that linear, though they are much better than google's output with their combination of features.
  
Task 2: 
  
    training_examples["dist_from_SF"] = abs(training_examples["latitude"] - 38)
    validation_examples["dist_from_SF"] = abs(validation_examples["latitude"] - 38)


    minimal_features = [
      "median_income",
      "dist_from_SF",
    ]

    minimal_training_examples = training_examples[minimal_features]
    minimal_validation_examples = validation_examples[minimal_features]

    _ = train_model(
        learning_rate=0.01,
        steps=500,
        batch_size=5,
        training_examples=minimal_training_examples,
        training_targets=training_targets,
        validation_examples=minimal_validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)
    
    RMSE: 
    My model's RMSE output was 115.04 and it defintely looks far more linear than the combination of task 1’s features. Google's baseline was 141.59
