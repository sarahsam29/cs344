a. Solutions to task 1-3

  Task 1: 
    california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = (california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"]/
    california_housing_dataframe["population"])

    calibration_data = train_model(
	    learning_rate=0.005,
    	steps=500,
	    batch_size=5,
	      input_feature="rooms_per_person")

  Task 2: 
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 3))
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    plt.scatter(calibration_data["predictions"], calibration_data["targets"])
    
b. In this example, synthetic features were included to account for the variability in population for a given 
city block. Therefore we explored block populations as it related to median house value. As far as I understand,
synthetically features generally, are used to get out of a certain performance that you’re stuck in and don’t 
have the option to add new training data.

c. outliers are those predicted values that deviate from the line that describes the trend of your data. They 
are generally clipped (setting them to reasonable mins or max values).
