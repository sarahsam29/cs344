a. Solutions to task 1-2:

  Task 1: 
    cities['SanAndWide'] = (cities['Area square miles'] > 50 & cities['City name'].apply(lambda name: name.startswith('San')))
    cities

  Task 2: 
    cities.reindex([9,4,7,5])
    
b. Numpy is essential for scientific computation which includes elegant features on arrays or matrices, for example. But
Pandas, which is built upon NumPy, is especially useful when you need more sophisticated data analysis tools. Specifically, 
Pandas can elegantly handle large and messy datasets. It has the functionality to clean, restructure/manipulate, and analyze
real-world (dirty) data.    

c. There are times when data includes order, or dependence from one observation to the next, when you would not want that. 
This can lend to believing in a false correlation between response and predictor variables, and in the case of linear regressions
cause an issue with the criteria of autocorrelation. Therefore, shuffling your data can randomize it. Or, in contrast, if you 
realize that your messy data needs some type of order, you can choose to reindex to reflect an order.
