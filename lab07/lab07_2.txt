a. Categorical data is generally text-based, and can be thought of overarching groups or classifications. It is possible 
for categorical data to be numbers, only if the numbers cannot have arithmetic functions performed on them. Numerical data,
on the other hand, is one that is a number (integer, float) on which it makes sense to perform arithmetic functions on.

b. Solutions to Task 1-2 :

  Task 1: 
    train_model(
	  learning_rate=0.00002,
	  steps=600,
	  batch_size=2)

  RMSE: 166.50
  
  Task 2: 
    train_model(
	learning_rate=0.00002,
	steps=1200,
	batch_size=2,
	input_feature="population")

c. The hyperparameters are learning_rate, steps, and batch_size. There are no standards because the effects of different 
hyperparameters are dependent on the data. But there are general rules to follow: the training error should decrease, the 
training should eventually converge, have reasonable batch sizes to avoid instability, and the training error should not 
decrease too slowly or have a dramatic variance.
